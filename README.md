- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @misty-mullin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in querying databases, conducting exploratory analyses, using machine learning to build predictive models (supervised & unsupervised), and doing research to improve science. My personal interests include the latest Artifical Intelligence in terms of automation, as well as, traveling, music, sports, and my 3 English Pointers. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement and deploy deep learning models.
